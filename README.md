Local Fonts
============
This is a WordPress plugin which is coded by the WiiDatabase Team. It is specifically for the TwentyThirteen theme:
1. It removes all calls to Google Fonts server (preconnect too)
2. It loads all fonts local

You can customize the plugin to your liking! Use the [Google WebFonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) to download your fonts and create the right CSS. Then, just adjust the CSS and the fonts folder.
